      content:
        'The abbreviation CUAET means “Canada-Ukraine Authorization for Emergency Travel”, but in general, the situation does not have to be an emergency to issue such a document, since it’s viable to any Ukrainian passport holder or family member married or related to a citizen of Ukraine\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Among other things, CUAET visa holders can obtain a work permit free of charge during the application process and receive assistance in finding work almost immediately upon arrival. Also, they are not required to provide a COVID-19 vaccination certificate and a certificate of a complete medical examination, instead, all necessary documents related to healthcare can be issued later if there will be such a need\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Due to the nature of the program and the needs of the people it is designed to help, CUAET applications are processed faster than regular visa applications, allowing entry to be granted much faster than when applying for a regular visa\n'

      title: 'What are the stages required to obtain CUAET visa ?',
      content:
        'The first application step is to create an account on the Government of Canada official website. To do this, you will need an invitation code that will be sent to You in a letter to the specified email address. It is important that this is your personal email, as in the future you will receive several more important letters to it\n' +
        '\n' +
        'The code will give you access to a site where you will need to create an account to complete the following steps (it is best to write down the login and password, as access to the account will be needed later to track the status and submit other applications). Further on the site you will need to fill out a visa application form, after selecting the application form for CUAET from the list, as well as submitting that you are applying on your own behalf, or select the appropriate option if this is the application form of your relative or family member\n' +
        '\n' +
        'To fill out the questionnaire, the only document you need is a passport, but there is an option to add medical and other certificates, attistates, diplomas and other documents. Their presence will not affect the process of obtaining a visa in any way, but by entering them into the questionnaire, they will also be attached to a work permit, profile of a pupil or student. The visa application form will be in English (with the possibility of translation to any other language in the browser) and it is important to remember that if the page was closed, all progress will be lost, so you should initially set aside a few hours to fill it out the from entirely\n' +
        '\n' +
        'After sending the questionnaire within the next few days you will receive an email with the information about where and when you will need to come to submit biometric data, which will be the last step. At the time of writing this material, only the point in Warsaw is working, but you will receive the most up-to-date information by email\n'

      title: 'What else do you need to know about the CUAET program and moving to Canada ?',
      content:
        'First of all, it is worth mentioning that, as stated on the official website of the program, this is not a program for refugees, but rather a temporary residence permit, so for those who left home with a backpack, it is better to think about less demanding options, such as a <a href="/spanish-resident-card">residence permit in Spain</a>\n' +
        '\n' +
        'The CUAET program also provides assistance for those who just arrived in Canada - this is not only a work permit, but also financial assistance in the form of a one-time payment of 3,000 Canadian dollars to quickly resolve the issue of housing and employment. The latter applies to those who arrive in Canada before March 2023, after which it will be necessary to take care of the work permit on their own\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Once the visa is approved, you will have two options for its implementation, and it is worth knowing their differences in advance. You can print the visa approval letter and use it immediately as an entry document, but it will only be valid for 3 years and only includes a one-time visit to Canada. The second option involves sending your passport to the Canadian consulate, where the visa will be pasted directly into it - in this case, the number of visits will be unlimited, and the visa will be valid until the penultimate day of validity of the passport (that’s why it makes sense to <a href="/international-passport?type=EXTENSION">extend the validity of the passport</a> before application). For sending a passport back, you will need to pay for its courier delivery to Your address (up to PLN 20) and the waiting time is from 2 to 4 weeks'
