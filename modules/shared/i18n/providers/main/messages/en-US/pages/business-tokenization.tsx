      title: 'How does it work and why is asset tokenization necessary ?',
      content:
        'A token is a virtual unit representing a certain product or service provided by your company. The value of this unit is dictated only by the value of the asset it represents, and therefore does not depend on fluctuations on the global market. The convenience of a token is primarily in the relative ease of accounting and asset management, for example, having a base of active customers, you can introduce your products and services on web marketing platforms in the form of tokens, which will consequently increase both profit and total capitalization\n' +
        '\n' +
        'The essence of tokenization is to create a virtual analogue of a real asset, whether it is a conventional unit of goods or an hour of work of a taxi driver or loader. With a competent team of analysts and auditors, managing and tracking company resources becomes much easier, and the cryptocurrency calculation model will optimize sales for further profit growth\n'

        'Tokenization involves the creation of a virtual accounting unit, but there are tokens for different types of assets, and here are the main ones:\n' +
        '\n' +
        '- Utility Tokens, also known as "points", reflect a certain value within the marketing model of your company. They can be earned for actions on the website, participation in sale events or gained when making purchases, for further exchange for vouchers or discounts\n' +
        '\n' +
        "- Equity Tokens, or digital stocks. Values as a representation of the company's shares for participation in auctions and stock markets, attracting investors and expanding the public offer\n" +
        '\n' +
        '- Asset-back Tokens, the most important and functional ones. They are the digital analogue of an asset, both physical (goods) and conditional (the equivalent of payment for an hour of work). Analytics of the of these token’s movement allows you to optimize sales or company resources\n'

      title: 'What you need to know about the taxation of tokens in Poland ?',
      content:
        'First of all, you need to decide whether to tokenize your business in Poland or in another country whose economic laws are more pliable in this regard?\n' +
        '- The answer to this question is fairly simple: if the business was registered in Poland and most of the employees are Polish taxpayers (and not necessarily Poles), then it is better to tokenize here, and European legislation provides all the necessary conditions for this\n' +
        '\n' +
        'What is needed to tokenize a business in Poland without breaking the law?\n' +
        '- To do this, you need to prepare a bundle of documents and submit it to the nearest office of the KNF (Financial Control Commission) in order to obtain the so-called "Interpretation" - a document legalizing the integration of tokens into your business. Such a permit is issued within 30 days, or 45 in the case of companies with an annual turnover of more than one hundred million PLN\n' +
        '\n' +
        'It is important to remember that the permission received in the future does not exclude the possibility of claims from the tax commission, which may try to oblige you to pay additional taxes and fines, or even turn into a court hearing. To avoid this, our experts can help to make adjustments to the Interpretation, as a result of which the claims from the tax authorities will be considered unlawful, and any court will take a verdict in your favor\n'

          'Along with the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies as a phenomenon, more and more entrepreneurs are implementing them in their business. The so-called tokenization of the company’s assets not only simplifies their management, but also opens up a lot of room for expansion, from connecting cryptocurrency wallets for payments to the introduction of voucher tokens and rewards for loyal customers or as part of sale events\n' +
          '\n' +
          "The guarantor of the conversion of tokens into funds is the company itself, so their rate will not depend on the world market, but only on the company's assets value. Although, often even successful entrepreneurs are not always able to deal with the introduction of cryptocurrencies into their business on their own, so we offer a wide range of services from integration to full support and advice on further optimization\n"
