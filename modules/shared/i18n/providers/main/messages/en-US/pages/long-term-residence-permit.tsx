      title: 'Which way can I get a residence permit in Poland ?',
      content:
        'A residence permit in Poland can be obtained based on several factors, depending on your purpose of stay in the country, and a document confirming this purpose will be the main one when applying. You can get a card for the following reasons:\n' +
        '\n' +
        '- Studying at a Polish university or high school. In this case, a residence permit is most often issued for the duration of the educational process, and when applying you will need to present a certificate of enrollment and confirmation of payment for at least the first year of studies\n' +
        '\n' +
        '- Employment. The terms in this case depend on whether there is an end date for your work or internship. If yes, then the card will be issued with a margin of 30 days after the end of this period, and if not, the period depends only on the consul who makes the decision on issuance. The main document in this case will be a certificate of employment issued by the company hiring you.\n' +
        '\n' +
        '- Business. If you are the owner, co-owner or investor of a company registered in Poland, you can obtain a residence permit for up to 5 years, and the document submitted to the consulate must contain information about the company, your position and the purpose of the visit\n' +
        '\n' +
        '- Marriage. As the spouse of an EU citizen, you can also qualify for a residence permit. In this case, you only need to provide a marriage certificate, but you need to remember that the card can be canceled in the event of a divorce earlier than 2 years after the date of the official marriage\n' +
        '\n' +
        '- Family reunion. Not the most common way to get a residence permit, but if your parent, relative or child is an EU citizen, then upon providing a certificate confirming kinship, you can get a card for a period of 5 to 10 years\n'

      content:
        'The number and type of documents for obtaining a citizen’s card depends on its type (temporary, work, student, long-term), but the core bundle remains unchanged:\n' +
        '\n' +
        '- Correctly completed application form, different for each type of card\n' +
        '- Original and three full copies of the international passport (or passports, if you have several)\n' +
        '- 5 printed color photos taken in compliance with the current consular requirements\n' +
        '- The document or documents on the basis of which you apply for the card (certificate of employment,education, language courses, etc.)\n' +
        '- Original and copy of an insurance policy that meets the current requirements for the type of card you want to receive\n' +
        '- Birth certificate translated by a certified translator\n' +
        '- A document confirming your address of residence in Poland\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Most certificates and documents are not difficult to obtain, however, our experts guarantee all possible assistance in obtaining and processing them. A complete list of documents for your case can be found at on the official website of the consulate or by calling our hotline\n'

      title: 'What is the card issue term and what does it depend on ?',
      content:
        'For each reason for staying in Poland, there are recommended periods for a residence permit, but it is important to remember that the final decision remains with the consul, and it depends only on the specific case. For example, in the case of obtaining a card for study a year before its completion, it is unlikely that it will be possible to obtain it for more than a year. You cannot influence this decision, but the end of the term of the received card is not yet a signal to pack the luggage\n' +
        '\n' +
        'You can apply for a residence permit again, and by taking into account factors such as your credit history, law relations and the success of your studies or work, the consul will most likely issue the next card with a longer term\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Having a good social reputation after receiving a third or even a second card, you can try to get a resident card (Karta Stałego Pobytu), which will not only have a much longer term, but almost equates You to a citizen, except for the right to vote in elections and purchase land in " perpetual use"\n'
