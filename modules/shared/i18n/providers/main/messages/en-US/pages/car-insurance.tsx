      title: 'Why do You need car insurance in Poland?',
      content:
        'First of all, you need to understand that car insurance in Poland is mandatory, with the exception of vintage collectible cars that are not intended for driving and cars for a test drive, which may not be insured while being exhibited. For all other vehicles, including motorcycles, the UOC (Ubezpieczenie Odpowiedzialności Cywilnej) law applies. Lack of such insurance will result in a fine of up to PLN 6,000.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'The insurance policy also covers the driver’s financial losses in the event of an accident or natural disasters (from hail to floods), the risks of which haunt every driver daily. Naturally, without an insurance policy, you will also not be able to earn money on your transport, cross borders, sell or rent your car.\n'

      title: 'Which insurance policy to choose and what is the difference?',
      content:
        'There are several types of car insurance policies, and above all, we are talking about mandatory and optional insurance. Mandatory, also known as UOC (Ubiezpieczenie Odpowiedzialności Cywilnej) or simply OC covers:\n' +
        '- Financial consequences of an accident, regardless of who was driving the vehicle at the moment of the accident\n' +
        '- Repair of damages associated with the transport usage (in particular, loading and unloading trucks, pickups and industrial vehicles)\n' +
        '- Damage compensation for the second party in case if you were the culprit of the accident\n' +
        '\n' +
        'In addition there is an optional insurance or Auto Casco (AC), by adding it to your AC, you insure the car against:\n' +
        '- Consequences of natural disasters or extreme weather conditions like storm, hail, flood, hurricanes, etc.\n' +
        '- Vandalism or other malicious damage to your car\n' +
        '- Abduction or theft of a vehicle\n' +
        '- Encounters with wild animals (which happens more often than it seems)\n' +
        '- Fire and other consequences of a critical car malfunction\n' +
        'The flexibility of the optional insurance policies allows you to choose a package based on the budget or the number of threats you want to insure against\n'

      title: 'What documents are needed for car insurance?',
      content:
        'First of all, you need to prepare a bundle of documents without which you will be unable to apply for insurance. The list include:\n' +
        '- Vehicle registration certificate (the main document containing information about the car model, engine power, fuel tank capacity, etc.)\n' +
        "- Your driver's license and its translation, if it was issued in another country. Also, a translation is not needed for re-issued license (you can check how to do it here)\n" +
        '- A valid insurance policy (not required for cars bought in the salon), which is transferred from the previous owner when buying a car\n' +
        '- Contract of sale of the vehicle you want to insure\n' +
        '\n' +
        'After collecting all the necessary documents, you need to choose an insurance company and decide whether you will apply for optional insurance. Many companies offer a complete package that includes both OC and AC, as well as tire insurance or coverage for car service and minor repairs\n' +
        'Insurance company websites often provide a price calculator where you can choose the best policy based on your budget and needs. In case of difficulties, you can use the services of a consultant\n' +
        '\n' +
        'When the issue of choosing a policy is resolved, it remains to pay for the purchase - this can be done both at the office of the insurance company and via the Internet. The most popular way to pay for insurance is monthly, but you can also pay for a year or several years in advance\n'
