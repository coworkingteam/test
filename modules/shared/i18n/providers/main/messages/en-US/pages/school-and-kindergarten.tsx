            '- Primary school (Szkoła podstawowa, podstawówka). A five-year course divided into two stages - for grades 1-3 it is an integrated study, without a clear division into subjects, after which grades 4 and 5 introduce both specific lessons and a final exam on them\n' +

After passing the exams and receiving a certificate of primary education, the student must pass it, since a place for him is guaranteed in your district school.
