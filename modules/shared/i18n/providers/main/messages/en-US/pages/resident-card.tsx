        '- In a short time after that, you will be assigned for a visit for an interview with the consul and taking biometric data\n' +

      content:
        'The first real obstacle is the waiting list, depending on the season the virtual queue can be filled up to two month ahead\n' +
        '- The possible solution is to register in the queue even before collecting all the documents. The waiting period is enough to get all the papers, and precious weeks will already be saved\n' +
        '\n' +
        'The second and most common reason for delays is the request for additional documents/references/translations. It can take from 2 to 3 weeks from the inspectorâ€™s request to delivering a document fulfilling it\n' +
        '- The best solution would be a patient preparation of a bundle of documents, taking into account possible future requests (for example, it is better to have a sworn translation of an important document, which will eliminate both delay and possible additional waste of both time and money)\n' +
        '- It is worth taking such papers as a certificate from the place of residence, work or study as last one, so that the date of issue is not outdated by the time it will be checked by consul\n' +
        '\n' +
        'It is impossible to foresee everything, and some documents will have to be added and delivered, for which the inspector gives 14 days without taking into account the time required for sending papers by mail\n' +
        'The best thing you can do while waiting for your card is to check your mailbox, both physical and electronic, more often to respond as quickly as possible, and spare no effort to receive and send the necessary papers as soon as possible\n'

      content:
        'In addition to the points listed above, there is always a chance that the reason for the delay does not depend on you, but there are several mechanisms for such case, and if you use them correctly, the case can be easily moved forward\n' +
        '\n' +
        'The first is a so-called "Remembrance letter" to the consulate (Ponaglenie). With proper execution, it will draw the attention of the consul to your case, and speed up the process of its consideration. There is no generally accepted form for such a letter, but it should contain a statement in a mild form that the protracted processing prevents you from seeing loved ones, making business trips, or simply causes inconvenience. Such a letter can and should be sent every month after the expiration date, but most often you will receive an answer and result after the first two letters\n' +
        '\n' +
        'If the letters do not help, and there is no time and resources to bring the case to court, you can make an appointment with the consul or inspector, where you can see for yourself at what stage the case is and find out the reason for the delay. After such a visit, the statistical majority of foreigners receive a card within 20-30 days\n'
