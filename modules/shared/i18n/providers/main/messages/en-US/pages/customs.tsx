        'First of all, you should pass a preliminary technical inspection, since when buying a car from another country (especially the USA), some of its specifications may not meet the requirements of Polish commissions. More detailed requirements can be found on the official website of the customs service or road administration\n' +
        '\n' +
        'It should also be remembered that, for example, a sales contract (when buying a car in another country) will need to be translated into Polish, as well as all documents related to transport. Otherwise, institutions in Poland will not be able to operate with them and your car’s clearance can be denied \n' +
        '\n' +
        'It is worth preparing for the fact that the payment of duties and taxes in total will be about 20-30% of the car’s cost, so when allocating a budget for a new car, you should always remember about the additional costs for insurance, registration, customs clearance, technical inspection and possible obligatory modifications associated with bringing a vehicle to a condition that meets the requirements\n' +
        '\n' +
        'In addition to the documents related to the car, yours should also be in order. It should be remembered that only a EU citizen or a foreigner who has all legal grounds for being in the country and crossing its borders can clear the car through customs\n'

        'When the documents are in proper order, you should go to the border guard office (Urząd Celny) and pay all the appropriate excises and duties, with confirmation of which and the collected bundle of documents, you can go to the city municipal institution (Urząd Miejski)\n' +
        '\n' +
        'There it will be possible to obtain the accompanying application forms, as well as get a little advice on how to fill them out. At this stage, many difficulties arise, since it is necessary to accurately script the data from the vehicle registration certificate, the sales contract and the insurance policy into the form. To save some time, you can pre-download the form and fill it out at home, but to rest assured we recommend you to contact our team of experts who will prepare all the necessary paperwork, thereby saving you time and effort\n' +
        '\n' +
        'After all the forms are filled out, you should go to the inspector for an appointment (the recording method depends on the specific department) and providing all the necessary papers, if there will be no errors and inconsistencies, you will be given a temporary registration certificate, registration document, a set of stickers and number plates on the very same day. Within 30 days after submitting the application, you will be assigned a date for receiving a permanent registration certificate\n'

        'For a comprehensive explanation of all taxes and types of duties for cargo machinery, industrial and specialized vehicles, you can contact the customs service, but for usual cars, the following excises and taxes apply:\n' +

        '- The 10% duty on cars bought from non-EU countries\n' +
        '- The 22% duty on heavy and industrial transport\n' +
        'It is worth remembering that cars purchased in EU countries are not subjected to duties. Also, the tax amount depends on the declared price of the car, but most often the customs officers check the price themselves and adjust the amount of the tax\n' +

        '- Excise tax 3.1% on cars with engine capacity up to 2000 cm³\n' +
        '- Excise tax of 18.6% on a car with bigger engine capacity\n' +

        'Additionally value added tax (VAT) 23% is imposed if the car that:\n' +
        '- Was not purchased in an EU country\n' +
        '- Was first registered more than 6 months before the procedure\n' +
        '- Has been acquired abroad by a firm or legal entity\n' +
        'The contract of sale was concluded between two EU citizens in the territory of any of its countries is not subject to this tax \n' +
